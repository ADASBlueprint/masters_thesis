The process to create the HD maps consists of joint processing of large amount of data originating from various sources. These data go through various post-processing steps using associated software to create a resulting HD point cloud map. To run these processes successfully require an appropriate processing server, a correct flow of processing sequence and validation of the input/output data. These processes are error-prone and time-consuming for human users. This paper is presented to illustrate practicality of an automated processing system for the creation of HD map, which can boost the efficiency of data processing for the whole system.},

If there's an issue or problem in terms of accuracy with the navigation system it may harmful for the vehicle and the surrounding environment. So to determine the vehicle localization and position GPS (Global Positioning System) which uses the reference geographical coordinates determine the Vehicle localization and position. But there are some drawback of the this (GPS) system which has physical barrier error, multipath error signal strength week in the tunnel near tall buildings is also need to consider in operation path of the vehicle and also the signal from the GPS get affected by surrounding environment change in the climate. So for that purpose we need the system which can not affected by environment changes and problem related to signal strength that is IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) which consists of total 6 axis i.e. 3 for acceleration in X, Y, Z direction and Gyroscope Axis in X, Y, Z axis which provides the Yaw rate, Pitch rate, Roll rate it will provide the signal in the absence of GPS signal so that IMU is a loosely coupled with GPS by using Kalman filter.},

  abstract={In order to improve the real-time and computational efficiency of autonomous vehicles' decision-making process, this paper draws on the decision-making behavior of human drivers with the motivation as the core and proposes a decision-making and planning method based on motivation and risk assessment. On the one hand, it analyzes and determines the motivations that cause the driving state to change for decision-making and planning. On the other hand, on the basis of the lateral trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles, the longitudinal trajectory propensity prediction of different drivers is added to construct a risk assessment model that can reflect risk of the future time domain. Based on this, the motivation-based decision method is mapped into the risk assessment model, and a cost function is established to decouple the path and speed, so that the geometry and speed can be flexibly adjusted according to environmental risks. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively make driving behavior decisions and plan the trajectory in real time according to the current environment, which can improve the computational efficiency of the decision-making process and guarantee the safety at the same time.},

This method utilizes a two-level hierarchy consisting of on-road behavior planning and online path generating to achieve feasible paths for autonomous vehicle in dynamic on-road environment which is characterized by lots of structured information and flat terrain. An on-road behavior planning technique is used to transform the uncertain path planning problem into several determined sub-ones. Then, the online path planning algorithm is applied to solve these sub-problems. This method contains three major components: anytime behavioral replanning, online path planning and mitigation strategy for time lag due to an agent system with asynchronous multi-sensor. We evaluate the proposed method on the KUAFU-1, an autonomous vehicle prototype modified by ourselves. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully provide real-time feasible paths in various on-road traffic sceneries.},

  pages={556-564},
  abstract={Before widespread automated driving, driver assistance systems become more common and can deliver safety benefits. This study focuses on current and future lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems and their potential safety effects by analysing real-world crash data and LKA's possibilities to prevent fatal passenger car crashes. The analysed data includes in-depth analysis of 364 fatal head-on and single-vehicle crashes in Finland. According to statistical analysis, 27% of these crashes could potentially have been prevented had currently available LKA been deployed. In this study, many issues are examined related to the lane markings' visibility, infrastructure, weather, and driver-related risks, which rationalise the results, compliment previous research, and highlight possibilities to increase the safety potential of LKA. Related to the lane markings' visibility, safety potential could be improved by allocating more resources to road maintenance and to snow clearance. Advanced LKA enabling exploiting digital lane markings could hypothetically almost double the safety potential as weather conditions or the visibility of lane markings would not restrict LKA's operation. While the driver is still in charge of driving tasks, driver-related risks are difficult to manage and the crashes caused intendedly or due to driver's attack of illness are not preventable by current LKA systems.},

Since the next generation of ACC systems and more advanced driver-assistant systems are at the verge of complete introduction and deployment, it is necessary to summarise the development and research achievements of the first generation of ACC systems in order to provide more useful experiential guidance for the new deployment. From multidimensional perspectives, this paper looks into the related development and research achievements to objectively and comprehensively introduce an ACC system to researchers, automakers, governments and consumers. It attempts to simply explain what an ACC system is and how it operates from a systematic perspective. Then, it clearly draws a broad historical picture of ACC development by splitting the entire history into three different phases. Finally, the most significant research findings-related ACC systems have been reviewed and summarised from the human, traffic and social perspectives respectively. }

  abstract={Adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems are designed to provide longitudinal assistance for drivers to enhance safety and reduce workload. As the core of all ACC control algorithms, the spacing policy plays a crucial role in various aspects. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on spacing policies for existing ACC solutions in the literature. The objectives of this paper are to clarify the operating mechanisms and characteristics of the common spacing policies, and to reveal their advantages and shortcomings by means of a comparative study. In this survey, the general evaluation criteria for spacing policies are first introduced. Then, the existing spacing policies are categorized into different types according to their operating mechanisms, and their characteristics are carefully reviewed and explained. A comparative study is followed to analyze the performances of five typical spacing policies in the literature, including the constant spacing policy, constant time headway, traffic flow stability, constant safety factor and human driving behavior spacing policies. The contents provided in this paper serve as a tool for understanding current ACC spacing policies, and pave the way for future ACC enhancement.},

  abstract={This paper presents a computational control algorithm for a vehicle to track a reference path within the automated lane centering system (ALC). The system aims to provide automatic lateral control by taking into account the physical and steering constraints imposed by the vehicle. A processing unit obtains the lateral error relative to the lane center and heading angle error from the center of its lane. To provide a smooth and continuous steering wheel angle as well as fast computation, the vehicle's kinematic and geometric models are unified and integrated with the controller of the system. The proposed control approach computes a steering wheel angle to track an ideal trajectory automatically. A proportional switching integral (PI) controller was implemented to control the vehicle speed. The path tracking algorithm is simulated for different vehicle speeds and curvy roads in TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator). The simulation results point out the effectiveness of the presented method, and indicate its wide practical application to self-steering and autonomous vehicles.},

These assistance systems ensure continuous monitoring of the environment of the vehicle and driving mode, so early detection of potentially hazardous situation. In a critical situation, these systems warn and provide active assistance to the driver and, if necessary, they work automatically to avoid a collision or reduce the consequences of an accident.

  abstract={Convolutional neural networks generally require considerable amount of data for training to perform adequately well in all real-world scenarios. Many times, the data for all scenarios is hard to collect and ground truth annotation is also a challenge. Similar problem exists in training networks for the autonomous vehicles given the diverse weather conditions where these cars are expected to be driven. Thus, a synthetic data generation model is imperative and we go about building a weather simulation framework. This framework is intended to generate weather conditions over different driving scenarios. To start with, we go about implementing a completely configurable rain/fog/windshield simulation model. The scope of this framework, however is much more than these three models. Apart from refining these models further as and when need, we intend to build in mechanisms to simulate more diverse weather conditions within this framework. There are multiple challenges in the implementation of these models. To begin with, we need a mechanism to simulate diverse weather conditions in a driving environment. One method could be to simulate the entire 3D environment, with the roads, automobiles, and an artificial world, but this approach would be extremely challenging both in terms of the realism that can be achieved, and in terms of the time it would take for the implementation. Another method is to overlay the rain/fog effect on top of pre-rendered videos. This 2D overlaying technique is a practical solution, since there exist many driving videos at our disposal. In this paper, we outline methods to implement this effectively, and showcase the results obtained in training a Neural Network with this approach.},
